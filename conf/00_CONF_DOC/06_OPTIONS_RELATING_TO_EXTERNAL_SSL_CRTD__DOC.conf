# OPTIONS RELATING TO EXTERNAL SSL_CRTD 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: sslcrtd_program
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-ssl-crtd
#
#	Specify the location and options of the executable for ssl_crtd process.
#	/usr/lib/squid3/ssl_crtd program requires -s and -M parameters
#	For more information use:
#		/usr/lib/squid3/ssl_crtd -h
#Default:
# sslcrtd_program /usr/lib/squid3/ssl_crtd -s /var/lib/ssl_db -M 4MB

#  TAG: sslcrtd_children
# Note: This option is only available if Squid is rebuilt with the
#       --enable-ssl-crtd
#
#	The maximum number of processes spawn to service ssl server.
#	The maximum this may be safely set to is 32.
#	
#	The startup= and idle= options allow some measure of skew in your
#	tuning.
#	
#		startup=N
#	
#	Sets the minimum number of processes to spawn when Squid
#	starts or reconfigures. When set to zero the first request will
#	cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.
#	
#	Starting too few children temporary slows Squid under load while it
#	tries to spawn enough additional processes to cope with traffic.
#	
#		idle=N
#	
#	Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available
#	at all times. When traffic begins to rise above what the existing
#	processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum
#	configured. A minimum setting of 1 is required.
#	
#	You must have at least one ssl_crtd process.
#Default:
# sslcrtd_children 32 startup=5 idle=1
