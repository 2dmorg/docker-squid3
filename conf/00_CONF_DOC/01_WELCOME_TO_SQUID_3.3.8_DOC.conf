#	WELCOME TO SQUID 3.3.8
#	----------------------------
#	
#	This is the documentation for the Squid configuration file.
#	This documentation can also be found online at:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/
#	
#	You may wish to look at the Squid home page and wiki for the
#	FAQ and other documentation:
#		http://www.squid-cache.org/
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq
#		http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples
#	
#	This documentation shows what the defaults for various directives
#	happen to be.  If you don't need to change the default, you should
#	leave the line out of your squid.conf in most cases.
#	
#	In some cases "none" refers to no default setting at all,
#	while in other cases it refers to the value of the option
#	- the comments for that keyword indicate if this is the case.
#

#  Configuration options can be included using the "include" directive.
#  Include takes a list of files to include. Quoting and wildcards are
#  supported.
#
#  For example,
#
#  include /path/to/included/file/squid.acl.config
#
#  Includes can be nested up to a hard-coded depth of 16 levels.
#  This arbitrary restriction is to prevent recursive include references
#  from causing Squid entering an infinite loop whilst trying to load
#  configuration files.
#
#
#  Conditional configuration
#
#	If-statements can be used to make configuration directives
#	depend on conditions:
#
#	    if <CONDITION>
#	        ... regular configuration directives ...
#	    [else
#	        ... regular configuration directives ...]
#	    endif
#
#	The else part is optional. The keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
#	must be typed on their own lines, as if they were regular
#	configuration directives.
#
#	NOTE: An else-if condition is not supported.
#
#	These individual conditions types are supported:
#
#	    true
#		Always evaluates to true.
#	    false
#		Always evaluates to false.
#	    <integer> = <integer>
#	        Equality comparison of two integer numbers.
#
#
#  SMP-Related Macros
#
#	The following SMP-related preprocessor macros can be used.
#
#	${process_name} expands to the current Squid process "name"
#	(e.g., squid1, squid2, or cache1).
#
#	${process_number} expands to the current Squid process
#	identifier, which is an integer number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) unique
#	across all Squid processes.
